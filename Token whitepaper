Introduction 
The real estate sector has long been characterized by centralization, high entry 
barriers, low liquidity, and a lack of transparency. Traditional property transactions 
involve layers of intermediaries, time-consuming paperwork, and jurisdictional 
complexities that deter both individual and institutional investors. Access to 
accurate, real-time property data is limited, while cross-border investments are 
constrained by regulatory and operational hurdles. 
Moreover, property ownership and verification systems are fragmented and 
vulnerable to fraud or misrepresentation. Liquidity remains a major limitation, as 
real estate assets are not easily divisible or tradable on secondary markets. As a 
result, both property owners and prospective investors face a rigid and outdated 
financial infrastructure. 
NOEM (New Opportunity Estate Management) is built to transform this reality. It 
offers a decentralized, trustless, and automated ecosystem where physical 
properties are tokenized into digital assets on the blockchain. These 
propertybacked NFTs represent fractional ownership, enabling seamless 
investment, transfer, and monetization of real estate across borders. 
Using cutting-edge AI models, NOEM introduces intelligent property risk analysis, 
empowering users with actionable insights into property valuation, legal exposure, 
and environmental risk. These risk scores directly influence smart contract-driven 
lending, staking, and insurance protocols, creating a truly data-driven and fair 
financial system. 
By integrating blockchain transparency with AI-powered decision-making and 
decentralized finance tools, NOEM delivers a next-generation real estate 
infrastructure that is inclusive, secure, and globally accessible — unlocking new 
opportunities for investors, developers, and homeowners alike.

Market Opportunity 
The global real estate market is one of the largest asset classes in the world, valued 
at over $300 trillion. Despite its vast size and importance, the industry remains 
structurally inefficient and technologically underdeveloped. Barriers such as high 
capital requirements, lengthy transaction processes, opaque pricing, and limited 
access to international markets continue to restrict broader participation. 
Today, less than 3% of real estate assets are accessible to average investors, and 
property liquidity remains a critical bottleneck. Cross-border real estate investment 
is often restricted by legal complexity, inconsistent data, and lack of infrastructure 
that supports secure and fractional ownership. 
NOEM addresses this massive opportunity by unlocking the potential of property 
tokenization. Through blockchain-based digital assets, physical properties can be 
turn into tradable tokens, enabling fractional ownership, global access, and realtime liquidity. Investors around the world can participate in real estate markets 
without geographic or regulatory limitations, using their EVM-compatible wallets. 
In parallel, NOEM introduces AI-driven risk modeling and transparent on-chain 
data to build trust and intelligence into property investment. The platform 
empowers users with access to property-backed NFTs, lending and borrowing 
services, and AI-assisted insights — creating a new economic layer where real 
estate assets become more fluid, programmable, and inclusive than ever before.

NOEM Ecosystem Overview 
1. AI-POWERED BLOCKCHAIN EXPLORER 
The NOEM ecosystem introduces an advanced AI-powered blockchain explorer 
specifically designed for property-related data and digital asset management. 
Unlike traditional blockchain explorers that require technical knowledge and offer 
limited context, the NOEM explorer features an intuitive interface enhanced with 
natural language processing and real-time assistance. 
Users can interact with the system by simply asking questions or issuing 
commands in plain language. 
At the heart of this experience is an integrated AI assistant that acts as a personal 
blockchain analyst. It interprets user intent, fetches relevant on-chain data, provides 
context-aware responses, and even guides users through complex operations such 
as staking, wallet interactions, risk analysis requests, or transaction validation. 
This tool dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for newcomers while providing 
powerful insights and functionality for experienced users. It supports seamless 
interaction with the Bahamut blockchain and offers a frictionless, user-centric 
experience that makes blockchain navigation simple, transparent, and empowering 
— especially for property investors, developers, and institutions.

2. NFT MARKETPLACE FOR TOKENIZED PROPERTIES 
The NOEM ecosystem features a dedicated NFT marketplace tailored for property 
tokenization — enabling users to convert physical property assets into 
blockchainbased digital tokens. This process allows individuals, businesses, and 
institutions to represent real-world properties as verifiable NFTs (Non-Fungible 
Tokens) on the Bahamut chain. 
Through a simple and secure interface, users can tokenize their own properties by 
submitting relevant documentation, undergoing on-chain KYC/AML verification, 
and generating a smart contract that binds ownership and property data to a unique 
NFT. Each NFT becomes a proof-of-ownership and a programmable asset, capable 
of being traded, rented, staked, or used as collateral across the NOEM platform. 
The marketplace supports curated NFT collections based on asset class, 
geography, or investment type — such as: 
● Residential estates 
● Commercial buildings 
● Investment properties 
● Land parcels 
● Co-owned developments or fractional offerings 
By organizing listings into intuitive categories, NOEM simplifies navigation and 
boosts discoverability for investors and property managers alike. 
This innovative approach turns traditional real estate into liquid, globally accessible, 
and divisible digital assets, removing historic barriers like high capital 
requirements, legal bottlenecks, and jurisdictional fragmentation. NOEM’s NFT 
marketplace creates a new digital economy where property ownership and 
investment are reimagined for the decentralized era.

3. ON-CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT 
NOEM introduces a next-generation on-chain risk management system that 
enhances both security and user experience across the real estate and DeFi 
ecosystem. At its core is a user-friendly, blockchain-native KYC/AML 
verification process designed to uphold compliance standards while preserving 
user privacy and control. 
Through a seamless, decentralized flow, users can verify their identity directly via 
their EVM-compatible wallets, without relying on centralized intermediaries. The 
verification process is fully encrypted and secured on-chain, ensuring that sensitive 
identity data is tamper-proof, transparent, and protected from unauthorized access 
or misuse. 
This architecture eliminates the need for off-chain storage or third-party data 
custodians, greatly reducing the risks of data leakage, impersonation, or fraud. 
Once verified, a user’s identity status can be cryptographically proven across the 
NOEM ecosystem without exposing underlying personal data — enabling 
frictionless interaction with DeFi services, property listings, and legal agreements. 
Additionally, NOEM uses AI to analyze property-related data (e.g., legal clarity, 
location, environmental factors, ownership history) and generate dynamic risk 
scores that are embedded into smart contracts. These scores influence 
decisionmaking in lending, staking, and insurance modules, allowing for riskadjusted financial behavior on-chain. 
This robust on-chain risk framework lays the foundation for trustless, secure, and 
intelligent property transactions, while maintaining compliance with evolving 
regulatory expectations globally and within the jurisdiction of Armenia.

4. DEFI LENDING & BORROWING 
NOEM’s DeFi Lending & Borrowing module introduces a secure, transparent, 
and AI-enhanced financial layer for tokenized real estate assets. It allows property 
owners to unlock liquidity by using their tokenized assets — such as 
propertybacked NFTs — as collateral, while enabling lenders to earn yield based 
on transparent, risk-adjusted returns. 
Borrowers can seamlessly lock their verified property NFTs in smart contracts to 
take out loans in stablecoins or other supported tokens. These loans are governed 
by pre-set terms automatically enforced by blockchain logic, removing the need for 
traditional financial intermediaries. 
A defining feature of NOEM’s DeFi framework is its AI-driven risk scoring 
engine. Before issuing loans, the system evaluates the underlying property’s risk 
profile based on factors like: 
● Location and market volatility 
● Ownership history and legal clarity 
● Environmental or structural risk 
● Real-time valuation and liquidity metrics 
Each property receives a dynamic risk score, which directly influences the 
interest rate, collateral ratio, and insurance requirements. Lenders, in turn, 
benefit from an intelligent underwriting system that protects their capital and aligns 
rewards with risk exposure. 
This model ensures a self-regulating, trustless lending ecosystem where capital 
flows efficiently, and property value is utilized without forced sales or complex 
refinancing. Combined with NOEM’s on-chain identity verification, the DeFi 
platform becomes a cornerstone of secure, inclusive, and decentralized real estate 
finance.

5. PROPERTY MANAGEMENT TOOL 
The NOEM ecosystem provides a comprehensive Property Management Tool
built on blockchain, designed to simplify and automate the ongoing management 
of real estate assets. This suite of decentralized applications enables property 
owners, investors, and managers to handle critical operational tasks on-chain with 
full transparency, auditability, and efficiency. 
Key features include: 
● Rent Tracking & Payments
Smart contracts automate rental agreements, due dates, and payments. 
Tenants can pay directly in crypto, with transactions instantly recorded 
onchain, and landlords receive verifiable payment histories. 
● Repair & Maintenance Scheduling
Property owners and tenants can log service requests, assign tasks to 
vendors, and confirm completion — all tracked securely on the blockchain 
for future reference and accountability. 
● Tax Documentation
Income and expense data is automatically compiled into tax-ready reports, 
streamlining end-of-year compliance and financial transparency. This data is 
cryptographically secured and time-stamped to eliminate fraud. 
● Insurance Integration
Users can connect with on-chain insurance providers and automate claims, 
renewals, and premium payments based on the property’s verified condition 
and risk profile. 
● Compliance Reporting
Smart contracts help enforce regulatory requirements such as lease terms, 
local compliance checklists, and utility performance — particularly useful in 
multi-unit or jurisdictional real estate operations.NOEM redefines how real

A. Tokenization of Real-World Assets (NFT Minting)
 Users tokenize real estate, land, or physical investments by minting NFTs.
 Fees: Paid in NOEM token.
 Destination: Sent to treasury, partially burned.
B. Buy/Sell Property NFTs
 Marketplace allows users to list and buy tokenized assets (NFTs).
 Fees: Paid in NOEM by buyers or sellers.
 Destination:
o Protocol Fee → Treasury
o Creator Royalty → NFT owner
o Gas Fees → Bahamut network
C. AI Assistant Services
 AI assistant answers questions, analyzes investment opportunities, manages tokens.
 Fee Types:
o Basic queries: Free or minimal NOEM fee

 Destination:
o Free-tier = no fee
o Premium tier = partially burned, remainder to treasury
18
D. Property Risk Scoring
 AI evaluates each property NFT using real-world data: location risk, legal history, environmental risk.
 Use Case: Required before using property NFT as lending collateral.
 Fees: Fixed NOEM fee per scoring request.
 Token Path: Sent to protocol → partially burned → rest to risk module fund
 Property Risk Analysis Framework 
AI models assess property value, location volatility, legal disputes, and 
environmental factors to generate a dynamic risk score. These scores feed into 
DeFi lending and insurance decisions. 
E. Property Management Tools
 Includes: rent tracking, taxes, repairs, legal docs, insurance
 Fees: Monthly or annual usage fees in NOEM
 Destination: Treasury (used for operating or reward redistribution)

3. Burning Mechanism — How and When It Happens
Burning reduces token supply permanently. This helps maintain long-term token value and balances demand.
What gets burned:
Source Burn 
Ratio Notes
AI Risk Scoring 20–50% Scaled by complexity
Property NFT 
Minting 10–25% Higher for commercial real 
estate
DeFi Protocol Use 
Fees 10–15% Certain loan origination or 
insurance
How it's burned:
 The smart contract sends a percentage of the NOEM fee to the zero address (0x00...)
 These tokens cannot be recovered and are permanently removed from circulation
Burning = deflation + value reinforcement over time
20
4. Staking Mechanism 
Users Stake NOEM in the Ecosystem
 Stake NOEM to gain rewards from protocol fees
 Use-case-specific staking: real estate pools, insurance underwriting, validator support
Example: Property Investment Staking
 NOEM holders stake tokens in vetted real estate projects
 Receive passive income from project 
 Staking contracts managed by Platform 
Rewards come from:
 Platform fees (transactions)
 Real-world rental profits (if integrated)
 A portion of treasury funds
5. Treasury Control & Governance
Treasury receives:
 Platform usage fees (minting, AI, risk, sales)
 Unused ecosystem funds
 Returns from staking
Treasury can:
 Fund grants and growth incentives
 Recycle tokens to liquidity pools
 Burn surplus tokens to reduce supply
 Be governed by staked NOEM holders
21
Technical Architecture 
NOEM is built on a modular and scalable architecture that integrates blockchain
technology, AI models, and decentralized storage to provide a seamless, secure, 
and intelligent ecosystem for real estate tokenization and management. Each 
component is optimized for trustlessness, efficiency, and user experience. 
• Smart Contracts 
All key operations — including token minting, NFT issuance, staking, lending, 
identity verification, and marketplace transactions — are executed through 
Solidity-based smart contracts. These contracts are audited prior to 
deployment to ensure security, transparency, and resistance to common exploits. 
Contract logic is designed to be modular, allowing for upgrades as the protocol 
evolves. 
• AI Models 
NOEM integrates advanced AI models trained on global property datasets, risk 
profiles, and economic indicators. These models process structured and 
unstructured data — including satellite imagery, legal documentation, and 
market trends — to deliver risk assessments, property valuations, and investor 
insights. The AI layer is tightly coupled with smart contracts to feed real-time 
decision data into lending, staking, and insurance protocols. 
• Storage Infrastructure 
The platform uses IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized, 
immutable storage of off-chain documents and metadata, such as property deeds, 
22
verification files, images, and inspection reports. All transactional and financial 
data is recorded on-chain via the Bahamut blockchain, ensuring full auditability 
and permanence without compromising user privacy. 
• Frontend & Wallet Integration 
The NOEM frontend is developed with a modern and responsive stack that 
integrates directly with Thirdweb wallet infrastructure. This allows users to 
access the platform through a wide range of EVM-compatible wallets (e.g., 
MetaMask, WalletConnect) and perform actions like minting NFTs, submitting 
verification, or participating in DeFi pools — all through a seamless and intuitive 
interface. 
This architecture ensures that NOEM is not only technologically robust, but also 
user-centric and adaptable — empowering users across all experience levels to 
participate confidently in the tokenized real estate ecosystem. 
 
 
23
Legal Considerations 
The NOEM token (symbol: NOEM) is designed and structured as a utility token
that powers access to services and functionalities within the NOEM ecosystem. It 
is not intended to function as a security, and based on preliminary legal 
assessments, it does not fall under the classification of a security under 
Armenian law. 
The token is used to pay for services such as AI-based property risk assessments, 
property management tools, NFT minting fees, and platform-level governance. It is 
not offered as a financial investment, and ownership of NOEM tokens does not 
entitle holders to any profit-sharing, dividends, or ownership rights in the NOEM 
organization or its assets. 
All users, contributors, and participants are expected to comply with the legal 
and regulatory requirements of their own jurisdictions, particularly in relation 
to digital asset usage, KYC/AML compliance, taxation, and cross-border 
transactions. NOEM provides on-chain identity verification to support legal 
integrity while preserving user privacy. 
The NOEM team is committed to operating with full transparency and ethical 
standards. The project welcomes external legal and technical audits, and 
continuously monitors international regulatory trends to ensure alignment with 
evolving legal frameworks. Additionally, the platform maintains jurisdiction in 
the Republic of Armenia, where blockchain innovation is actively supported. 
This legal foundation reinforces the project's legitimacy and commitment to 
responsible ecosystem growth.
